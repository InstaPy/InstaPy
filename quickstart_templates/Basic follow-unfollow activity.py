What does this quickstart script aim to do?
- Basic follow/unfollow activity.

NOTES:
- I don't want to automate comment and too much likes because I want to do this only for post that I really like the content so at the moment I only use the function follow/unfollow.
- I use two files "quickstart", one for follow and one for unfollow.
- I noticed that the most important thing is that the account from where I get followers has similar contents to mine in order to be sure that my content could be appreciated. After the following step, I start unfollowing the user that don't followed me back.
- At the end I clean my account unfollowing all the users followed with InstaPy.
