### Added
- A new feature - Interact By Comments to **auto-like** comments, **auto-reply** to them, etc. (_see **README**_).  
- New text analytics - MeaningCloud Sentiment Analysis API & Yandex Translate API (_Language Detection & Translation_) integrated into **InstaPy** for doing _sophisticated_ text analysis (_see **README**_).

### Changed
- Speed up _logging in_ at least 25 (_default `page_delay`_) seconds (_see #ee6acba commit_).
- Upgrades to `live_report()` feature (_"Sessional Live Report" uses it.._). Now it is more smarter.
