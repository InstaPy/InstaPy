### Instagram Like, Comment and Follow Automation Script

> Automation Script for “farming” Likes, Comments and Followers on Instagram.  

Implemented in Python using the Selenium module.

#### Example

```python
from instapy import InstaPy

InstaPy(username='test', password='test')\
  .login()\
  .set_do_comment(True, percentage=10)\
  .set_comments(['Cool!', 'Awesome!', 'Nice!'])\
  .set_dont_include(['friend1', 'friend2', 'friend3'])\
  .set_dont_like(['food', 'girl', 'hot'])\
  .set_ignore_if_contains(['pizza'])\
  .like_by_tags(['dog', '#cat'], amount=100)\
  .end()
```
## It’s easy to use and the built in delays prevent your account from getting banned. (Just make sure you don't like 1000s of post/day)

### Getting started

#### You need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7 or 3.6 installed. Setted up path for PY command. Installed [Selenium](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) and [pyvirtualdriver](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyVirtualDisplay).

#### Make sure to get the right ```chromedriver``` for your system from here: [https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads). Just put it in ```/assets```.

> If you're not too familiar with code and you're working on Windows, try out this tool to set up the settings: [InstaPy Windows GUI](https://github.com/Nemixalone/GUI-tool-for-InstaPy-script)

```bash
cd InstaPy
pip install .
```

or

```bash
cd InstaPy
python setup.py install
```

If you want the script to get the username and password for your environment, you can do:

```
export INSTA_USER="<Your username>"
export INSTA_PW="<Your password>"
```
---

```python
from instapy import InstaPy

#if you don't provide arguments, the script will look for INSTA_USER and INSTA_PW in the environment

session = InstaPy(username='test', password='test')
session.login()

#likes specified amount of posts for each hashtag in the array (the '#' is optional)
#in this case: 100 dog-posts and 100 cat-posts
session.like_by_tags(['#dog', 'cat'], amount=100)

#gets tags from image passed as instagram-url and likes specified amount of images for each tag
session.like_from_image(url='www.instagram.com/p/BSrfITEFUAM/', amount=100)

#likes 50 photos of other animals

session.like_by_tags(['#animals'], amount=50, media='Photo')
session.like_from_image(url='www.instagram.com/image', amount=50, media='Photo')

#likes 15 videos of cats

session.like_by_tags(['#cat'], amount=15, media='Video')
session.like_from_image(url='www.instagram.com/image', amount=15, media='Video')

session.end()
```

##### Restricting Likes

```python
#completely ignore liking images from certain users

session.set_ignore_users(['random_user', 'another_username'])
```

```python
#searches the description and owner comments for the given words
# and won't like the image if one of the words are in there

session.set_dont_like(['food', 'eat', 'meal'])
```
##### Ignoring Restrictions

```python
#will ignore the don't like if the description contains
# one of the given words

session.set_ignore_if_contains(['glutenfree', 'french', 'tasty'])
```

##### Commenting

```python
#default enabled=False, ~ every 4th image will be commented on

session.set_do_comment(enabled=True, percentage=25)
session.set_comments(['Awesome', 'Really Cool', 'I like your stuff'])

# you can also set comments for specific media types (Photo / Video)
session.set_comments(['Nice shot!'], media='Photo')
session.set_comments(['Great Video!'], media='Video')
```

> **Emoji Support**  
>
> You can use Unicode characters (like Emoji) in your comments, but there are some limitations.
> 1. You can use only Unicode characters with no more than 4 characters and you have to use the unicode code (e. g. ```\u1234```). You find a list of emoji with unicode codes on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji#Unicode_blocks), but there is also a list of working emoji in ```/assets```  
>
> 2. You have to convert your comment to Unicode. This can safely be done by adding an u in front of the opening apostrophe: ```u'\u1234 some comment'```

##### Following

```python
#default enabled=False, follows ~ every 10th user from the images, times=1 (only follows a user once (if unfollowed again))

session.set_do_follow(enabled=True, percentage=10, times=2)
```

##### Following by a list

```python
#follows each account from a list of instagram nicknames (only follows a user once (if unfollowed again))
# would be useful for the precise targeting. For example, if one needs to get followbacks from followers of a chosen account/group of accounts.

accs = ['therock','natgeo'] 
session.follow_by_list(accs, times=1)
```

##### Excluding friends

```python
#will prevent commenting on and unfollowing your good friends (the images will still be liked)

session.set_dont_include(['friend1', 'friend2', 'friend3'])
```

##### Interactions based on the number of followers a user has

```python
#This is used to check the number of followers a user has and if this number exceeds the number set then no further interaction happens

session.set_upper_follower_count(limit = 250)
```

```python
#This is used to check the number of followers a user has and if this number does not pass the number set then no further interaction happens

session.set_lower_follower_count(limit = 1)
```

##### Unfollowing

```python
#unfollows 10 of the accounts you're following -> instagram will only unfollow 10 before you'll be 'blocked for 10 minutes' (if you enter a higher number than 10 it will unfollow 10, then wait 10 minutes and will continue then)

session.unfollow_users(amount=10)
```

##### Running on a server ?

```python
#you can use the nogui parameter to use a virtual display

session = InstaPy(username='test', password='test', nogui=True)
```

### Clarifai ImageAPI

###### Note: Head over to [https://developer.clarifai.com/signup/](https://developer.clarifai.com/signup/) and create a free account, once you’re logged in go to [https://developer.clarifai.com/account/applications/](https://developer.clarifai.com/account/applications/) and create a new application. You can find the client ID and Secret there. You get 5000 API-calls free/month.

If you want the script to get your Clarifai_ID and Clarifai_Secret for your environment, you can do:

```
export CLARIFAI_ID="<ProjectID>"
export CLARIFAI_SECRET="<Project Secret>"
```
#### Example with Imagecontent handling

```python
from instapy import InstaPy

InstaPy(username='test', password='test')\
  .login()\
  .set_do_comment(True, percentage=10)\
  .set_comments(['Cool!', 'Awesome!', 'Nice!'])\
  .set_dont_include(['friend1', 'friend2', 'friend3'])\
  .set_dont_like(['food', 'girl', 'hot'])\
  .set_ignore_if_contains(['pizza'])\
  .set_use_clarifai(enabled=True)\
  .clarifai_check_img_for(['nsfw'])\
  .clarifai_check_img_for(['food', 'lunch', 'dinner'], comment=True, comments=['Tasty!', 'Nice!', 'Yum!'])\
  .like_by_tags(['dog', '#cat'], amount=100)\
  .end()
```
##### Enabling Imagechecking

```python
#default enabled=False , enables the checking with the clarifai api (image tagging)
#if secret and proj_id are not set, it will get the environment Variables
# 'Clarifai_SECRET' and 'CLARIFAI_ID'

session.set_use_clarifai(enabled=True, secret='xyz', proj_id='123')
```
##### Filtering inappropriate images

```python
# uses the clarifai api to check if the image contains nsfw content
# -> won't comment if image is nsfw

session.clarifai_check_img_for(['nsfw'])
```
##### Specialized comments for images with specific content

```python
#checks the image for keywords food and lunch, if both are found,
#comments with the given comments. If match_all is False (default), it only
# requires a single tag to match Clarifai results.

session.clarifai_check_img_for(['food', 'lunch'], comment=True, comments=['Tasty!', 'Yum!'], match_all=True)
```

###### Check out [https://clarifai.com/demo](https://clarifai.com/demo) to see some of the available tags.</h6>

### Running it with Docker

#### Build the Image

You first need to build the image by running this in the Terminal:
```bash
docker build -t instapy .
```

#### Run in a Container

After the build succeeded, you can simply run the container with:
```bash
docker run --name=instapy -e INSTA_USER=<your-user> -e INSTA_PW=<your-pw> -d instapy
```
